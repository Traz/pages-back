After your succefull Rails 4 install, you can't run it (`rails server`), because your SQLite3 isn't compatible with Ruby 2 yet.

Checking Google, i've found this : <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyinstaller/gedIaMryCFQ/discussion> and this <https://gist.github.com/luislavena/5120722>

So,

1. uninstall the sqlite3 gem for cleaning : `gem uni sqlite3` 

2. download the knapsack found in the discussion, and place it in a temp repertory (ie _c:/dev/temp_). 

3. compile sqlite3 with the knapsack `gem install sqlite3 --platform=ruby -- --with-opt-dir=C:/dev/temp` 

4. Test it :
    {% highlight irb %}
    irb
    require 'sqlite3'
    SQLite3::SQLITE_VERSION` => "3.7.15.2"
    {% endhighlight %}

You're good :) Thansk Luis.

PS : often Rails need to update some gem, but it you want to keep some special gem (like this sqlite3), don't use `bundle update` but `bundle update --local` and install manually missing gem.
