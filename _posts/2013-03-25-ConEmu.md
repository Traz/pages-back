### Console2 reboot

I've used for long time the very good [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/). But i've discovered last month a russian programmer who has build some really good stuff !

So first, go to [ConEmu](http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/) and install it (pick the dev build, it has some good new features and work well !)

### ConEmu basic configuration

ConEmu can be fine tuned with a lot of configuration possibility. In the setting :

- Main / Appearance : check the _quake style_ and _auto hide on focus_ for having a nice pop up console, check _enhance progressbars_ for auto hidding progressbars
-  Features : check _inject conemu_ and _ansi xterm 256 colors_ for highlighting mode
- Keys & Macro / Mark & Paste : check all the box from the _select text with mouse_ and select the _paste_ action for the right button (mode _auto_).

Move arround and test !

### ConEmu Task

You can define multiple standard task in _startup/tasks_.

I've created a first simple :

- taskname : start
- task parameters : 
- command : `cmd -new_console:d:C:\Dev\home`

It's the most important part. The format of the macro command is :

    program-name -new_console:options-console parameter-for-the-program

Take a look at the about box for remenber the options :

    -new_console[:switches]
      or
    -cur_console[:switches]
       a - RunAs shell verb (as Admin on Vista+, login/passw in Win2k and WinXP)
       b - Create background tab
       c - force enable 'Press Enter or Esc to close console' (default)
       d:<dir> - specify working directory, MUST BE LAST or single OPTION
       h<height> - i.e., h0 - turn buffer off, h9999 - switch to 9999 lines
       i - don't inject ConEmuHk into starting process
       n - disable 'Press Enter or Esc to close console'
       o - don't enable 'Long console output' when starting command from Far Manager
       r - run as restricted user
       s[<SplitTab>T][<Percents>](H|V) - run new console in a split
       t:tabname - rename new created tab, MUST BE LAST or signle OPTION
       u - ConEmu choose user dialog
       u:<user>:<pwd> - specify user/pwd in args, MUST BE LAST or signle OPTION

### Simples examples

Just add a task with : `cmd` in the third input ('commands ...') with a title (first input). You can now lanch a DOS shell simply.

Next step : launch  the bash shell (sh.exe is en the PATH) : `sh -login -i`.

And for a Git shell (not in my path) : `c:\dev\git\bin\sh.exe -login -i`

If you want to specify the starting directory, you have to use the -new_console switch : `c:\dev\git\bin\sh.exe -cur_console:d:C:\www\github\ -login -i` for example.

### Starting a batch file in a new console

Depending on each program, for bash it's the swith `-c`.
So, assume i want to launch a Ruby pry console from the bash shell : `sh -new_console:d:C:\www -l -i -c "pry"`.
You can do the same for a rails console, a rails server, a jekyll server ...

### Launch several windowed consoles

    >c:\dev\git\bin\sh.exe -cur_console:d:C:\www\github\traz.github.com -login -i
    sh.exe -cur_console:s1TH:d:C:\www\github\traz.github.com -login -i -c "jekyll serve"

On the first line, I launch a git bash shell (whith full route besause it's not in my PATH) with option -login -i, with a starting directory specified (:d switch)

On the second line, I launch the Jekyll local server and with the switch `s1TH` for (s)eparing the current (1)st one console in 2 (H)orizontal windows.

The `>` caracter select which console is active.

So when the task is launch, I've got my Git shell and my local server up.

Another example with Rails :

    >sh -cur_console:d:C:\www\red -l -i -c "rails console"
    c:\dev\git\bin\sh.exe -cur_console:s1TH:d:C:\www\red -login -i
    sh -cur_console:s2TV:d:C:\www\red -login -i -c "rails server"

In this one, I've a got a PRY rails console (check the 'pry-rails' gem in gemfile), a Git shell, and the rails server up.

### Attach & Inside ...

Lasts words : You can attach a program in ConEmu ... try it, it's surprising on the first time :) But it extend the tasks possibilities :

Now in a new task, just put `"C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\sublime_text.exe" ` ... and Yes ! you've got Sublime Text IN a tab console, working perfectly :) ... you can test with other programs :)

And for finish, you can do (it's a testing feature I assume, there some nasty behaviours) the exact oposite : integrate ConEmu in a Windows Explorer ! First, register ConEmu in the Explorer context menu (it's in tab Features / Integration in ConEmu), and second, right click in the explorer on ConMenu Inside :)

**A big thanks again to the programmer of ConEmu !!!**
